The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive full-stack web application for BD Garaj using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. The development followed an iterative approach, starting with a basic informational site and progressively adding complex features. Key accomplishments include robust API development for services, appointments, and blog posts, a secure admin panel with JWT authentication, a fully functional image upload system with static file serving, PWA capabilities with QR codes for mobile installation, and the integration of dynamic content management for various homepage sections. The project also saw the introduction of an OTO-MOTO Alım Satım module and the partial implementation of a YEDEK PARÇA system, demonstrating strong full-stack proficiency and responsiveness to evolving user requirements. The agent also effectively managed large file modifications by breaking them down into manageable steps.
